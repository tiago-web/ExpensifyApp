# React - ExpensifyApp
This is my own aproach of a course project.

## Focus
This project was designed to create an functional and user friendly interface that allow the user to manage their expenses.

## Features 
- Add, edit or remove expenses
- Filter expenses by text, startDate, and endDate
- Sort expenses by date or text

## Difficulties
Since this project involves client-side routing, I encountered some challenging tasks. However, the react-router documentation is easy to read and has many good examples, so I was able to overcome my barriers.

## Dependencies
- ReactJS, ReactDOM
- ReactRouterDOM
- Redux & ReactRedux
- ReactDates & Moment
- NodeSass(SCSS)
- Normalize.css
- Uuid
