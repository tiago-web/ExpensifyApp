# React - ExpensifyApp
This project is my approach to a course project.

## Focus
The application was designed to create a functional and user-friendly interface that allows the user to manage their expenses.

## Features 
- Add, edit or remove expenses
- Filter expenses by text, startDate, and endDate
- Sort expenses by date or text

## Difficulties
Since this project involves client-side routing, I encountered some challenging tasks. However, the react-router documentation is easy to read and has many good examples, which helped me a lot to overcome my barriers.

## My approach
Because the original project was designed in the past, it didn't use React Hooks. Nevertheless, in my version, all of the features are updated with React Hooks, including Redux and React Router. Also, I'm planning more features.

## Dependencies
- ReactJS, ReactDOM
- ReactRouterDOM
- Redux & ReactRedux
- ReactDates & Moment
- NodeSass(SCSS)
- Normalize.css
- Uuid
